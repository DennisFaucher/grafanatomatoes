Grafana Config and Dashboard for Top DVD &amp; Streaming on Rotten Tomatoes

I have been adding Plex stats to my latest Grafana dashboard and thought an updated list of new DVD & streaming would be a nice add. Since Rotten Tomatoes is not giving our API keys any longer, I searched around and found [this great site](https://pypi.org/project/rotten_tomatoes_client/) on a "public API". I played with the examples and the instructions in the code until I had the correct JSON URL.
